# PowerBi-Dashboard
The project that I developed in PowerBI aimed to analyze the feasibility of the UK achieving its Net Zero emissions agreement by 2050. To accomplish this, I gathered data from various sources on the internet, including data on the UK's internal emissions and emissions data from several European countries.

The project was divided into three main areas of analysis: supply, demand and capabilities. In the supply analysis, I looked at the current production and consumption of fossil fuels in the UK and compared it to other European countries. The demand analysis focused on the UK's energy consumption patterns and how they are likely to change in the future. Finally, in the capabilities analysis, I evaluated the UK's ability to implement and maintain renewable energy sources and energy-efficient technologies.

Using PowerBI, I created interactive visualizations that allowed me to easily compare the data and draw insights from the information. The visuals included bar charts, line graphs, and maps that helped me to understand and communicate the findings of the project. Additionally, I added a dashboard that allows the user to interact with the different visuals and see the data in a dynamic way.

Overall, the project was a great opportunity to apply my skills in data analysis and data visualization in PowerBI, and helped me to understand the complexity of the Net Zero emissions agreement and the UK's position in relation to other European countries.
